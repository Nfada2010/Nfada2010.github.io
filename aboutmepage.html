Where i am From

<body>
    Born and raised in Cleveland i love the classics; the Browns, Coleslaw on hamburgers, and i believe there are only two seasons winter or construction. 
    I grew up in the trucking industry going to my families warehouse after school and playing on the dock.
    I have spent the last few years starting and growing my own Sameday shipping company in Columbus. 
    While the business matured I took on more roles to meet the new company needs. 
    Technology became my number one focus, the more i learned, the more i wanted to learn.
    What started out as a way to troubleshoot printer problems became a new medium for me to enhance and further develop my business as well as myself.
