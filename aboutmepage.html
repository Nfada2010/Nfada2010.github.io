    About Me
</title>

<body class="bodyText">
    -Born and raised in Cleveland I love the northeast ohio classics; the Browns, Coleslaw on hamburgers, and i believe there are only two seasons winter and construction. 
    I grew up in the Shipping industry going to my families warehouse after school and helping around the dock.
    I have spent the last few years starting and growing my own Shipping company in Columbus. 
    While the business matured I took on more roles to meet the new demands. 
    Technology quickly became my number one focus, the more i learned, the more i wanted to learn.
    What started out as a way to troubleshoot printer problems became a new medium for me to enhance and further develop my business as well as myself.
