        About Me
    </title>

    <body class="bodyText">
        -Born and raised in Cleveland Ohio. I love The Browns, Coleslaw on hamburgers, and i believe there are only two
        seasons Winter and Construction.
        I grew up in the Shipping industry going to my families warehouse after school and helping around the dock.
        I have spent the last few years starting and growing my own Shipping company in Columbus.
        While the business matured I took on more roles to meet the new demands.
        Technology quickly became my number one focus, the more i learned, the more i wanted to learn.
        What started out as a way to troubleshoot printer problems became a new medium for me to enhance and further
        develop my business as well as myself.
